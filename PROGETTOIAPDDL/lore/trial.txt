In the distant realm of Elmyra lies the Emerald of Dawn, an ancient gem capable of awakening the power of the Solar Guardians. The gem is kept within the partially submerged Temple of Tides—accessible only through a hidden passage beneath the waves.
Your hero, a young traveler named Arin, begins his journey at the Port of Murias. There, a seer entrusts him with the quest: recover the Emerald of Dawn and carry it to the Sanctuary of Light atop the Golden Hills.
To reach the temple, Arin has two alternate routes:
1. The Sunlit Cliffs – a steep, winding trail through immense, glowing rock formations—haunted at dusk by living stone golems that shatter any who linger too long.
2. The Shadowed Marsh – a mist-shrouded swamp home to the mirelle, small amphibious creatures—and the only place to find the ancient Glass Lantern needed to unlock the underwater door to the temple.
Once inside the Temple of Tides, Arin must locate the Coral Lockpick and use it together with the Glass Lantern to deactivate the magical wards guarding the Emerald of Dawn. Only then can he return to the Sanctuary of Light and fulfill his mission by delivering the gem.
