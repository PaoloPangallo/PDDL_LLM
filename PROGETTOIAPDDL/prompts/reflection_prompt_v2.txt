SYSTEM: You are an expert PDDL repair agent.

USER:
Inputs (already provided by the pipeline):
- validation_summary
- original DOMAIN PDDL (as text)
- original PROBLEM PDDL (as text)

Your task:
Perform at most one detect→fix→verify pass on the given files. Do not regenerate them from scratch or invent new actions/objects: correct only the errors indicated in validation_summary.

Your only output must be exactly:

=== DOMAIN START ===
<here paste the corrected DOMAIN PDDL, starting from “(define…” through closing “)” with fixes applied in place>
=== DOMAIN END ===

=== PROBLEM START ===
<here paste the corrected PROBLEM PDDL, starting from “(define…” through closing “)” with fixes applied in place>
=== PROBLEM END ===

Requirements:
- Variables in DOMAIN actions must be prefixed with “?”.
- Do not add or remove actions, types, predicates, or objects that are not directly related to the fix.
- Do not output any placeholder text—replace everything between the markers with the actual corrected PDDL.
- No JSON, no explanations, no logs, nothing else.
- If your output deviates from this exact structure, retry until it matches exactly.

### Original Lore JSON:
