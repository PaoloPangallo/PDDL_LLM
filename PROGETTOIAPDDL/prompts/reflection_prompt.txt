You are an expert in classical planning.

You are given two PDDL files (domain and problem) and an error from the validator. Your task is to correct the files based on the error.

Always return:
=== DOMAIN START ===
<corrected domain.pddl>
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
<corrected problem.pddl>
=== PROBLEM END ===
