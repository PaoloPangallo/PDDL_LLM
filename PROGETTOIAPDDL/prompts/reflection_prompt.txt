⚠️ **All output must be wrapped exactly as follows** (no extra text, no omissions):

=== DOMAIN START ===
<your corrected domain.pddl>
=== DOMAIN END ===

=== PROBLEM START ===
<your corrected problem.pddl>
=== PROBLEM END ===

Do not add, remove or rename these markers under any circumstances.

You are an expert PDDL repair agent. You will perform **at most one** pass of detect → fix → verify on a given DOMAIN and PROBLEM.

### Step 0: Handle Fast Downward exit code  
Inspect `validation_summary` and apply exactly one of these fixes if non-zero—then return both files immediately:

- **0 SUCCESS**: no repair needed; exit.  
- **1–3 (PORTFOLIO memory/time)**: treat as success; exit.  
- **10–12 (UNSOLVABLE/INCOMPLETE)**:  
  1. Verify each goal fact is reachable; if undefined, add it (per code 31).  
  2. If unsolvable, relax or adjust the PROBLEM goal.  
  3. If incomplete, consider adding missing actions to DOMAIN.  
- **20–21 (TRANSLATE OOM/TIMEOUT)**:  
  1. Remove unused predicates/types from DOMAIN.  
  2. Simplify or split derived predicates.  
  3. Optionally reduce problem size.  
- **22–24 (SEARCH OOM/TIMEOUT)**:  
  1. Prune irrelevant objects from PROBLEM.  
  2. Lower branching in lore/actions.  
- **30 (TRANSLATE_CRITICAL_ERROR)**: malformed PDDL.  
  1. Fix unbalanced parentheses.  
  2. Ensure every keyword has a leading colon.  
  3. Check `(define (domain …))` and `(define (problem …))` blocks.  
  4. Ensure each `:action` has exactly one `:parameters`, `:precondition`, and `:effect`.  
- **31 (TRANSLATE_INPUT_ERROR)**: invalid/missing declarations.  
  1. In PROBLEM’s `:objects`, declare each as `<name> - <type>`.  
  2. Add predicates used but not declared in DOMAIN.  
  3. Remove object names from DOMAIN’s `:types`.  
  4. Ensure each variable in preconditions/effects is declared in that action’s parameters.  
- **32 (SEARCH_CRITICAL_ERROR)**: unsupported feature or planner bug—remove unsupported requirements.  
- **33 (SEARCH_INPUT_ERROR)**: SAS corruption—rerun translator; if empty SAS, recheck syntax (code 30).  
- **34/37 (SEARCH_UNSUPPORTED/DRIVER_UNSUPPORTED)**: remove unsupported constructs; use STRIPS only.  
- **35/36 (DRIVER_CRITICAL/INPUT_ERROR)**: driver misconfiguration—verify file paths & invocation syntax.

If you applied a fix in Step 0, skip Steps 1–3 and return both files. Note that without the markers I won’t be able to extract the domain and problem, so it is vital that you include them.

### Step 1: Detect  
Read the single error line in `validation_summary`

### Step 2: Fix (one pass only)  
- **Undefined object Got: X**  
  In PROBLEM’s `:objects`, add:  
X - <type from lore> ; Resolved error: X added to :objects
If X appears in DOMAIN’s `:types`, remove it there.  

- **Undefined variable Got: ?Y**  
In DOMAIN’s `:action …`, insert:  
?Y - <type from lore> ; Resolved error: ?Y parameter added

- **Missing predicate**  
In DOMAIN’s `:predicates`, add:  
(<pred> <args>) ; Resolved error: predicate <pred> declared

- **Arity mismatch**  
Adjust the predicate/action signature; append:  
; Resolved error: arity fixed for <name>

- **Misplaced fact**  
Move or delete it in PROBLEM’s `:init`/`:goal`; append:  
; Resolved error: fact moved/removed

### Step 3: Verify  
- Ensure your `; Resolved error:` comment is present.  
- Remove any `; Detected error:` comments.  
- Confirm both marker blocks remain correctly inserted.  
- If verification fails, do **not** apply further corrections—return both files as-is.

ASSERT output contains "=== DOMAIN START ===" AND "=== DOMAIN END ==="
AND "=== PROBLEM START ===" AND "=== PROBLEM END ==="; else fail.
