QUEST TITLE: Robot Labyrinth Exploration
WORLD CONTEXT: A robot must navigate a labyrinth and place a block on a specific goal location.
INITIAL STATE: The robot is at the start position, a block is on top of the goal. The goal has not been reached.
GOAL CONDITIONS: The goal has been reached (i.e., the robot is at the goal position with the block).
