To correct the provided PDDL files, I will need to know the specific error messages you are encountering. Here is a general template for classical planning domains and problems in PDDL format:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain domain-name)
  (:requirements :equality :qualified :strips :deterministic :typed :action-chaining)
  (:predicates
    (P1 ?x - type1)       ; Define your predicate here
    (P2 (AND ?x ?y - type2)) ; Note the use of 'AND' for binary predicates
    ...
  )
  (:action action-name
    (:parameters (?p - parameter1) (?q - parameter2))
    (:precondition (and (P1 ?p) (not (P2 ?p ?q)))) ; Define preconditions here
    (:effect (and (not P1 ?p) (not P2 ?p ?q) (P3 ?p))) ; Define effects here
  )
  ...
)
=== DOMAIN END ===

=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem problem-name :domain domain-name)
  (:object-schemas (ObjectSchema1 ObjectSchema2 ...))
  (:init
    (P1 ?o - ObjectSchema1)     ; Initialize the state here
    (not P2 ?o ?o)               ; Ensure that there are no initial conflicts
    ...
  )
  (:goal (P4 ?o))                 ; Define the goal here
  (:action-schemas (ActionScheme1 ActionScheme2 ...))
)
=== PROBLEM END ===

Here are some common errors and their solutions:

1. Missing ':' at the beginning of a line or before keywords like 'define', 'requirements' etc.:
   - Change this: (domain my-domain)
   - To this: (:domain my-domain)

2. Incorrect use of 'and' and 'or':
   - Replace 'AND' with 'and' (lowercase 'a') for binary predicates and boolean expressions within a condition.
   - Use 'OR' instead of ',' to combine alternative conditions in the precondition or effect clauses.

3. Incorrectly defined actions:
   - Ensure that each action is defined with parameters, preconditions, and effects.
   - Make sure that action names are unique within the domain definition.

4. Missing or incorrect object schemas:
   - Define object schemas for all types of objects used in the problem or domain definitions.
   - Use 'ObjectSchema' as the name for each schema, and define them at the beginning of the problem definition.

5. Incorrectly defined goals:
   - Ensure that there is a single goal for the problem, defining the desired state to be reached.
   - The goal should be expressed using a predicate with a single argument, representing the final state of the world.
