To solve this task, I will provide examples of corrections for common errors in PDDL files. Here are two examples:

Example 1: Error: Missing type definition for a predicate
----------------------------------------------------------

### DOMAIN START ###
```pddl
(define-fun goal-reached? (agent) -1
   (and (at agent location-goal) (holding agent key)))
```

### Error message:
Error at line 3, column 22: Function 'location-goal' is undefined in domain.

### CORRECTED DOMAIN START ###
```pddl
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:predicates
      (at -1 agent location)
      (holding -1 agent object))
   (:action actions
      ;; action definitions go here
      )
   (:funcs
      (location-goal -1))
)
```

### CORRECTED DOMAIN END ###

```pddl
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:predicates
      (at -1 agent location)
      (holding -1 agent object))
   (:action actions
      ;; action definitions go here
      )
   (:funcs
      (goal-location -1))
)
```

### PROBLEM START ###
```pddl
(define (problem my_problem)
   (:domain my_domain)
   (:objects agent1 agent2 object1 object2 key)
   (:init
      (and (at agent1 start-location) (not (holding agent1 key)))
      (at agent2 start-location)
      (holding agent2 key))
   (:goal (goal-reached? agent1)))
```

### PROBLEM END ###

Example 2: Error: Predicate not declared as a static or dynamic predicate
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

### DOMAIN START ###
```pddl
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:predicates
      (at -1 agent location))
   (:action actions
      (move (agent)
         (conditions ...)
         (effects (at ?dest agent) (not (at ?source agent))))
   )
)
```

### Error message:
Error at line 7, column 10: Predicate 'source' is not declared as dynamic in domain.

### CORRECTED DOMAIN START ###
```pddl
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:predicates
      (at -1 agent location))
   (:action actions
      (move (agent source dest)
         (conditions ...)
         (effects (at dest agent) (not (at source agent))))
   )
)
```

### CORRECTED DOMAIN END ###

```pddl
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:predicates
      (at -1 agent location))
   (:action actions
      (move (agent source dest)
         (conditions ...)
         (effects (not (at source agent)))))
)
```

### PROBLEM START ###
```pddl
(define (problem my_problem)
   (:domain my_domain)
   (:objects agent1 location1 location2 key)
   (:init
      (at agent1 start-location))
   (:goal (at agent1 end-location)))
```

### PROBLEM END ###
