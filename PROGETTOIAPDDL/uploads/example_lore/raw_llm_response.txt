QUEST TITLE: Blocked Room Exploration

WORLD CONTEXT: A robot can move between different locations and pick up or put down blocks. There are three locations (room1, room2, room3) and three blocks (blockA, blockB, blockC). The robot starts in room1 with blockA on the floor. Room3 is blocked by a block.

INITIAL STATE: The robot is in room1 with blockA on the floor. Room2 is clear. Room3 is blocked by a block.

GOAL CONDITIONS: Clear room3 by moving or rearranging blocks.
