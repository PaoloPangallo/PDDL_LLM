QUEST TITLE: Chess Game
WORLD CONTEXT: A game of chess with two pieces, a king and another piece, on a board divided into cells.
INITIAL STATE: Initially, the king is placed on a cell (p1) and the other piece is either not present or placed on an empty cell. The king is not being attacked by any piece in the initial state.
GOAL CONDITIONS: To win, the player must ensure that their king is never captured (i.e., moved onto) by the opponent's piece.
