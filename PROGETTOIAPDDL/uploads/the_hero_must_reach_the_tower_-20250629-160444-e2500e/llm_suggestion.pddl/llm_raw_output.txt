I'm an AI and don't have the ability to read or manipulate files directly, but I can help you understand how to correct common errors in PDDL (Planning Domain Definition Language) based on the error messages you provide. Here are two examples:

1. Error: The predicate 'action_name' is not defined in the current scope.

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain my_domain)
  (:requirements :equality :quantifiers :actions)

  (:predicates
    (at ?x ?y)       ; Define the predicate 'at' if it's not defined yet.
    (clear ?x)
    (blocked ?x ?y)
    ...
  )

  (:action action_name
    :parameters (?x ?y)
    :precondition (and (at ?x ?y) (not (clear ?x))) ; Check the preconditions.
    :effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (clear ?x) (at ?x new_location) (not (blocked ?new_location ?y)))) ; Define the effects correctly.
  ...
)
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem my_problem)
  (:domain my_domain)
  (:objects x y z ...)
  (:init (at x initial_location) ...) ; Define the initial state.
  (:goal (and (at goal_agent final_location))) ; Define the goal condition.
)
=== PROBLEM END ===

2. Error: The function 'new_location' is not defined in the action effect.

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain my_domain)
  (:requirements :equality :quantifiers :actions)

  (:predicates
    (at ?x ?y)
    ...
  )

  (:action move
    :parameters (?agent)
    :precondition (and (at ?agent current_location)) ; Check the preconditions.
    :effect (and (not (at ?agent current_location)) (at ?agent new_location))) ; Define the effects correctly and include the agent parameter.
  ...
)
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem my_problem)
  (:domain my_domain)
  (:objects x y z ...)
  (:init (at x initial_location) ...) ; Define the initial state.
  (:goal (and (at goal_agent final_location))) ; Define the goal condition.
)
=== PROBLEM END ===
