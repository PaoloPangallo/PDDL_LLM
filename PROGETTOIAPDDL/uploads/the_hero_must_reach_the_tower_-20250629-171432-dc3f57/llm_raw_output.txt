I am an assistant that can help you with PDDL files correction based on the error messages provided. However, please note that I can only provide guidance for common issues, and you may need to adjust the corrections based on your specific context. Here's a sample correction for a simple example:

Let's say the original domain file contains:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:requirements :equality :quantifiers :action-cost)
   (:predicates
      (at ?x - Location)
      (has_ball - Agent))
   (:action pickup
      (:parameters (?x - Location) (?y - Agent))
      (:precondition (and (at ?x ?y) (not (has_ball ?y))) )
      (:effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at ?x unoccupied) (has_ball ?y))))
   (:action putdown
      (:parameters (?x - Location) (?y - Agent))
      (:precondition (and (at ?x ?y) (has_ball ?y)))
      (:effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at unoccupied ?x) (not (has_ball ?y))))
)
=== DOMAIN END ===

The error message is: "Error: Invalid or missing :action-schema in action putdown."

To fix the issue, we should provide the required schema for each action:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain my_domain)
   (:requirements :equality :quantifiers :action-cost)
   (:predicates
      (at ?x - Location)
      (has_ball - Agent))
   (:action pickup
      (:parameters (?x - Location) (?y - Agent))
      (:precondition (and (at ?x ?y) (not (has_ball ?y))) )
      (:effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at ?x unoccupied) (has_ball ?y))))
   (:action putdown
      (:parameters (?x - Location) (?y - Agent))
      :action-schema (declare (effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at unoccupied ?x) (not (has_ball ?y))))
                               (condition (and (at ?x ?y) (has_ball ?y)))
                               (operation putdown))
      (:precondition (and (at ?x ?y) (has_ball ?y)))
      (:effect (and (not (at ?x ?y)) (at unoccupied ?x) (not (has_ball ?y))))
)
=== DOMAIN END ===

The corrected problem file would depend on the specific problem definition and the error message provided. In general, you should ensure that all action schemas are declared correctly and that preconditions, effects, and other action elements are defined as required by the PDDL standard.
