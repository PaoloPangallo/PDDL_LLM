I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly manipulate files, but I can help you understand the error and suggest corrections for your PDDL files based on the information provided. Here's a general template for correcting common errors:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain <domain-name>))

;; Define types, functions, and initial state here...

(define (predicate <predicate-name> :schema (= ?x1 ?type) :filter (and (not (equal ?x1 nil)) (instance-of ?x1 ?type))) :role-schema (?x1))
;; ... where you need to replace `<domain-name>`, `<predicate-name>` and `<type>` with appropriate values

=== DOMAIN END ===

=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem <problem-name> :domain <domain-name>)
  (:object-schema (and (InstanceOf ?x1 <type1>) ...))
  (:init (and (predicate P1 ?x1) ...)) ;; replace `P1` with the actual predicate name
  (:goal (and (not (predicate P1 ?x1)) ...))) ;; replace `P1` with the actual predicate name
=== PROBLEM END ===

Here's a breakdown of corrections based on possible errors in the validator message:

- Predicate name has a mismatch: Replace `<predicate-name>` and `P1` with appropriate values.
- Type definition is missing: Define types in the domain section, such as (define (type <type-name>)).
- Role schema mismatch: Ensure that the role schema matches the actual predicate schema (?x1) in the domain section.
- Instance of type missing: Make sure you define the object schema in the problem section, such as (:object-schema (and (InstanceOf ?x1 <type1>) ...)).
- Initial state condition mismatch: Ensure that the initial state predicate matches the one defined in the domain section.
- Goal state condition mismatch: Ensure that the goal state predicate matches the one defined in the domain section.
