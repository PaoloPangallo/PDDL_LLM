I am an expert in classical planning, but please note that I am a model and do not have the ability to read or modify files directly. However, I can help you understand the error and suggest corrections for your domain and problem PDDL files based on the information provided about the error. Here is a general example of how I can assist:

Let's say the original domain file (domain.pddl) looks like this:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain simple-world)
  (:requirements :equality :typing :quantifiers)
  (:predicates
    (and on ?x - Location
         (not (= ?x nil))
         (All ?y (- Block - Object)
           (implies (on ?y ?x)
                     (or (and (= ?x Table) (clear ?y))
                         (and (= ?x Hand) (held ?y)))))))
  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?x - Location ?y - Block)
    :precondition (and (on ?y ?z) (clear ?x))
    :effect (and (not (on ?y ?z)) (on ?y ?x) (clear ?z)))
  (:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - Location ?y - Block)
    :precondition (and (on ?x ?y))
    :effect (and (not (on ?x ?y)) (clear ?y) (clear ?x))))
=== DOMAIN END ===

And the problem file (problem.pddl) looks like this:

=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem initial)
  (:domain simple-world)
  (:objects Table, Block1, Block2 - Block)
  (:init (and (on Block1 Table) (clear Block2)))
  (:goal (and (not (on Block1 Table)) (clear Block2))))
=== PROBLEM END ===

The error could be due to incorrect use of the 'All' and 'implies' constructs in the domain file. To correct it, you can modify the domain.pddl file as follows:

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain simple-world)
  (:requirements :equality :typing)
  (:predicates
    (and on ?x - Location
         (not (= ?x nil))
         (clear ?x - Location)))
  (:action pick-up
    :parameters (?x - Location ?y - Block)
    :precondition (and (on ?y ?z) (clear ?x))
    :effect (and (not (on ?y ?z)) (on ?y ?x) (clear ?z)))
  (:action put-down
    :parameters (?x - Location ?y - Block)
    :precondition (and (on ?x ?y))
    :effect (and (not (on ?x ?y)) (clear ?y) (clear ?x))))
=== DOMAIN END ===

In this corrected version, I removed the 'All' and 'implies' constructs from the domain file since they are not necessary for describing the problem. Instead, I added a separate 'clear' predicate to explicitly define clear locations. Additionally, I updated the 'on' predicate definition to remove the conditions that were part of the original 'All' construct.

Regarding the problem.pdl file, no changes are required as it appears to be correct based on the information provided in the domain file.
