I'm an AI and don't have the ability to directly edit files, but I can help you understand the error and suggest corrections. Here's an example of how I would correct a domain or problem file based on a common PDDL validation error:

Let's say we have the following invalid PDDL files:

**domain.pddl:**
```pddl
(define-fun goal-test? (x) (= x goal))
(defdomain blocks
  :requirements :equality
  (:predicate agent_at - Agent Location)
  (:action pickup
    :parameters (?a - Agent) (?b - Block)
    :precondition (and (agent_at ?a location1) (not (agent_at ?a location2)) (clear ?b ?c))
    :effect (and (not (agent_at ?a location1)) (agent_at ?a location2) (not (clear ?b ?c)))
  )
)
```

**problem.pddl:**
```pddl
(define (goal goal) (and (at agent block1) (not (at agent block2))))
(define (init) (and (at agent block0) (clear block0 block1)))
(problem blocks
  (:domain blocks)
  :objects (agent block0 block1 block2)
  :initial-state (init)
  :goal (goal))
```

The error in these files is that the domain and problem should have their respective starts and ends, and the goal predicate in the problem file should refer to a defined goal function. Here's how I would correct these files:

**domain.pddl:**
```pddl
(define-fun goal-test? (x) (= x goal))
(defdomain blocks
  :requirements :equality
  (:predicate agent_at - Agent Location)
  (:action pickup
    :parameters (?a - Agent) (?b - Block)
    :precondition (and (agent_at ?a location1) (not (agent_at ?a location2)) (clear ?b ?c))
    :effect (and (not (agent_at ?a location1)) (agent_at ?a location2) (not (clear ?b ?c)))
  )
)
=== DOMAIN END ===
```

**problem.pddl:**
```pddl
(define (goal goal) (and (at agent block1) (not (at agent block2))))
(defstate init
  (and (at agent block0) (clear block0 block1)))
(defgoal (goal-test? (at agent block1) (not (at agent block2))))
(problem blocks
  (:domain blocks)
  :objects (agent block0 block1 block2)
  :init (init)
  :state (any)
  :goal (goal))
=== PROBLEM END ===
```

In this corrected version, I defined a state `init` to represent the initial state in the problem and used it instead of an anonymous function. I also used the `defgoal` construct to define the goal correctly, referring to the defined `goal-test?` function.
