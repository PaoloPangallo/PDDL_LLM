I'm an assistant that helps correct errors in PDDL files based on the provided error message. Here's a simple example of how I might help with your request:

Let's assume you have the following errors in your domain and problem files:

**domain.pddl:**

```
(define (domain my-domain)
  :requires all (action do-something)
  :effects (condition (and (at p1 goal) (at p2 goal)))
  (action do-something
    :parameters (?x - integer)
    :precondition (and (at ?x start))
    :effect (and (at ?x goal))))
```

Error: Invalid or missing action name in the effects clause.

**problem.pddl:**

```
(define (problem my-problem)
  (:domain my-domain)
  (:objects p1 p2 start goal)
  (:goal (and (at p1 goal) (at p2 goal)))
  (:init (at p1 start) (at p2 start))
  (:action do-something :parameters (?x - integer) :precondition (at ?x start) :effect (at ?x goal)))
```

Error: Invalid or missing action name in the :action declaration.

Here's how I would correct them:

**domain.pddl:**

=== DOMAIN START ===
(define (domain my-domain)
  :requires all (action do-something)
  :effects (condition (and (at p1 goal) (at p2 goal)))
  (action do-something
    :parameters (?x - integer)
    :precondition (and (at ?x start))
    :effect (and (at ?x goal))))
=== DOMAIN END ===

**problem.pddl:**

=== PROBLEM START ===
(define (problem my-problem)
  (:domain my-domain)
  (:objects p1 p2 start goal)
  (:goal (and (at p1 goal) (at p2 goal)))
  (:init (at p1 start) (at p2 start))
  (:action do-something :parameters (?x - integer) :precondition (at ?x start) :effect (and (not (at ?x start)) (at ?x goal))))
=== PROBLEM END ===
