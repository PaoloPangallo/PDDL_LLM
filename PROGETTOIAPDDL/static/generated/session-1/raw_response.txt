Based on the provided JSON input, which does not contain any specific information about domain name, types, predicates, objects, init, goal, actions, etc., I will create a generic PDDL structure that follows the rules and format you've outlined. Since there is no specific data in the JSON for these elements, I will generate placeholder content that reflects typical usage but does not conflict with your requirements or detailed rules.

===DOMAIN===
```lisp
(define (domain example-domain)
  (:requirements :strips :typing)
  (:types t1 t2 t3)
  (:predicates
    (p1 ?x - t1)
    (p2 ?x - t1 ?y - t2)
    (p3 ?z - t3))
  (:action act1
    :parameters (?x - t1 ?y - t2)
    :precondition (and (p2 ?x ?y))
    :effect (and (p1 ?x) (not (p2 ?x ?y))))
  (:action act2
    :parameters (?z - t3)
    :precondition (and (p3 ?z))
    :effect (and (not (p3 ?z))))
)
```

===PROBLEM===
```lisp
(define (problem example-problem)
  (:domain example-domain)
  (:objects
    a1 a2 - t1
    b1 - t2
    c1 c2 - t3)
  (:init
    (p2 a1 b1)
    (p3 c1)
    (p3 c2))
  (:goal (and (p1 a1) (not (p3 c2))))
)
```

This PDDL content is generic and based on the structure you've provided, using placeholders for domain name, types, predicates, objects, init, goal, actions. Adjustments can be made if specific details from your JSON input are available to replace these placeholders.
