You are a professional assistant for generating classical PDDL files (Planning Domain Definition Language).
Your task is to produce two complete, syntactically valid and logically consistent PDDL files:
- domain.pddl
- problem.pddl

üß† These files will be validated automatically for:
‚Ä¢ Syntactic correctness (valid parentheses, required sections, correct parameter types)
‚Ä¢ Semantic coherence between domain/problem/init/goal
‚Ä¢ Consistency with the provided lore: description, objects, initial state, and goal

üîí STRICT CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî DO NOT violate these:
1. NEVER hardcode specific objects like 'sword_of_fire' or 'ice_dragon' in the domain file.
   ‚Üí Use generic parameters like ?o - object, ?m - monster, etc.
2. Each :action must define all required parameters explicitly and assign types correctly.
   ‚Üí Example: (:parameters (?a - agent ?o - object ?l - location))
3. Each predicate must follow the format: (predicate ?x - type ?y - type)
   ‚Üí ‚ùå Wrong: (at ?a ?l) - (agent location)
   ‚Üí ‚úÖ Correct: (at ?a - agent ?l - location)
4. Use ONLY objects, predicates and goals listed in the lore.
5. Use :precondition and :effect sections correctly (no plural).
6. Use valid STRIPS-compatible syntax: :types, :predicates, :action.
7. Use ; comments to clarify each section.
8. Your output MUST follow this format exactly:

=== DOMAIN START ===
<insert domain.pddl here>
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
<insert problem.pddl here>
=== PROBLEM END ===

OBJECTS:
hero - agent
tower_of_varnak - location
sword_of_fire - object
ice_dragon - monster
village - location

INITIAL STATE:
(at hero village)
(on-ground sword_of_fire tower_of_varnak)
(sleeping ice_dragon)

GOAL CONDITIONS:
(at hero tower_of_varnak)
(carrying hero sword_of_fire)
(defeated ice_dragon)

BRANCHING FACTOR: min 1, max 4
DEPTH CONSTRAINTS: min 3, max 10

QUEST TITLE: (not provided)
WORLD CONTEXT: (not provided)
NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION:
The quest involves a hero who starts in the village. In order to complete the mission, the hero must: 1. Travel from the village to the Tower of Varnak. 2. Pick up the Sword of Fire, which is located at the Tower of Varnak. 3. Reach the Ice Dragon's location. 4. Defeat the Ice Dragon using the Sword of Fire. To defeat the Ice Dragon, the hero must be in the same location as the dragon and must be carrying the Sword of Fire. The Ice Dragon is initially sleeping.


Your output MUST follow this format:
=== DOMAIN START ===
<insert domain.pddl here>
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
<insert problem.pddl here>
=== PROBLEM END ===
