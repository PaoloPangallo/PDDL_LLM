You are a professional assistant for generating classical PDDL files (Planning Domain Definition Language).
Your task is to produce two complete, **valid** and **logically consistent** PDDL files:
- `domain.pddl`
- `problem.pddl`

üõ†Ô∏è These files will be validated automatically for:
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Syntactic correctness (valid parentheses, sections, keywords)
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Semantic coherence between domain/problem/init/goal
‚Ä¢ ‚úÖ Consistency with the lore (description, objects, goal, init)

üîí STRICT CONSTRAINTS ‚Äî Do NOT violate these:
1. Use **ONLY** objects, types, and predicates provided in the lore.
2. Each predicate in the goal must be declared and consistently used.
3. Use **valid STRIPS-compatible PDDL syntax**:
   ‚Ä¢ Use `:precondition` and `:effect` (not plurals).
   ‚Ä¢ Parentheses must be properly closed.
   ‚Ä¢ Sections allowed: `(:types)`, `(:predicates)`, `(:action)`.
4. Do NOT invent non-standard sections like `(:problem-factors)` or `(:problem-depths)`.
5. Define realistic types (e.g., `agent`, `location`, `object`) **without self-referencing**.
6. Each `:action` block must be syntactically valid and well-formed.
7. Use `;` comments to describe each section clearly.
8. Keep the formatting clean, modular, and readable.
9. NEVER include placeholders like `<insert here>` or explanations in the output.

 OBJECTS:
hero - agent
tower-of-varnak - location
sword-of-fire - object
ice-dragon - monster
village - location

 INITIAL STATE:
(at hero village)
(on-ground sword-of-fire tower-of-varnak)
(sleeping ice-dragon)

 GOAL CONDITIONS:
(at hero tower-of-varnak)
(carrying hero sword-of-fire)
(defeated ice-dragon)

 BRANCHING FACTOR: min 1, max 4
 DEPTH CONSTRAINTS: min 3, max 10

 QUEST TITLE: (not provided)
 WORLD CONTEXT: (not provided)
 NARRATIVE DESCRIPTION:
The quest involves a hero who starts in the village. In order to complete the mission, the hero must: 1. Travel from the village to the Tower of Varnak. 2. Pick up the Sword of Fire, which is located at the Tower of Varnak. 3. Reach the Ice Dragon's location. 4. Defeat the Ice Dragon using the Sword of Fire. To defeat the Ice Dragon, the hero must be in the same location as the dragon and must be carrying the Sword of Fire. The Ice Dragon is initially sleeping.

 Your output MUST follow this format:
=== DOMAIN START ===
<insert domain.pddl here>
=== DOMAIN END ===
=== PROBLEM START ===
<insert problem.pddl here>
=== PROBLEM END ===
